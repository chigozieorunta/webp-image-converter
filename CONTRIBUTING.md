## Ways to contribute

Contributing isn't just writing code - it's anything that improves the project.  All contributions are managed right here on GitHub.  Here are some ways you can help:

### Reporting bugs

If you're running into an issue, please take a look through [existing issues](https://github.com/chigozieorunta/webp-image-converter/issues) and [open a new one](https://github.com/chigozieorunta/webp-image-converter/issues/new) if needed.  If you're able, include steps to reproduce, environment information, and screenshots/screencasts as relevant.

### Suggesting enhancements

New features and enhancements are also managed via [issues](https://github.com/chigozieorunta/webp-image-converter/issues).

### Pull requests

Pull requests represent a proposed solution to a specified problem.  They should always reference an issue that describes the problem and contains discussion about the problem itself.  Discussion on pull requests should be limited to the pull request itself, i.e. code review.

## Workflow

The `develop` branch is the development branch which means it contains the next version to be released. The `master` branch contains the corresponding stable development version. Always work on the `develop` branch and open up PRs against `develop`.

### Branching strategy

- For Hotfixes - hotfix/<branch_name>
- For Features - feat/<branch_name>
- For Fixes - fix/<branch_name>

### Prerequisites

- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.2 or later
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for dependency management.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for a local development environment.
